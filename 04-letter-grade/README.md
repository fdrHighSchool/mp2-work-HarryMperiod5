# Letter Grade
#### Respond to the following:

1. Write a plan for the following extension:
  * Attach a "+" on their grade if the grade ends in a 7, 8 or 9 (eg: 78 -> C+, 89 -> B+)
  * Attach a "-" on their grade if the grade ends in a 0, 1 or 2 (eg: 92 -> A-, 61 -> D-)

Write an if statement so if the last number in that number is a 7 8 or a 9, put a plus. If it is 0, 1 or 2 put a minus sign next to the letter.

2. Discuss how you would make sure 100 is not misrepresented as an A-.
I would type a an extra if loop if it is greater than or equal to 100, put a plus sign.

3. Discuss how you would make sure grades that are an F are not mislabeled as F- or F+ (eg: 49 -> F+ and 52 -> F-)
I would type an if statement if the grade is below a 65 don't add a plus or minus sign.
