#### Respond to the following:

1. Write a plan for the following output:
```
000111222333444555666777888999
000111222333444555666777888999
000111222333444555666777888999
```
First you would need to loop the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, 3 times in one row. Then you repeat that 3 times and set it to next line so it goes to the next line of code.

2. Write a plan for the following output:
```

```
First you need to loop the numbers, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 5 times in one row. Then once each of those numbers have looped 5 times in one line, you do println so the code goes to the next line when it loops, and you loops those numbers 5 more times in seperate lines of code.
